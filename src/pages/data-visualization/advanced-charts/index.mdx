Advanced charts are a powerful way to display complex data sets. While less intuitive than basic charts, the visualizations should still tell a story the user can understand.

## Alluvial diagram

Alluvial, or Sankey diagrams, are a type flow diagram designed to show two indicators of a dataset and how records distribute among them, highlighting correlations.

Multiple blocks of two indicators can be placed next to each other creating a wider alluvial diagram but it’s crucial to consider that this specific kind of chart does not show correlations between indicators that are not directly connected. This is usually emphasized using different set of colors for each block.

## Heat maps

A heat map is a graphical representation of data where the individual values contained in a matrix are represented as colors. When it comes to heat maps, the most common color ranges are expressed in either sequential and diverging color scales according to the typology of data represented.

#### Sequential scales

Sequential scales use a blended progression, typically of a single color, from the lightest to the darkest values, representing lows to highs. It’s best practice to use a sequential scale with values that are all positive or all negative. Sequential  heat maps can leverage the full range of the palette (from 10-100) to maximize contrast. Please note that the 3:1 minimum contrast requirement does not apply to heat maps.

#### Divergent scales

Diverging scales show color progression in two directions: dialing down the first value from one end to a neutral color at the inflection point (for example, a 0 value midway between -100 and +100), then increasing the opacity of the second value to the darker end of the scale.

Divergent scales require 3 colors for their 3 correspondent values (min, max and inflection point) and they are referred to as “symmetrical” when the min/max values match and “assymetrical” otherwise. Although some examples use the stepped scale provided by the Carbon palette, divergent heat maps often leverage continous values to accomodate situations that require more than 10 values.

#### Inflection points

While min/max values can be automatically detected from data, inflection points can vary depending on data type. We default to zero in order to accomodate the most common cases and include a feature flag within the code to specify exceptions.

## Tree diagram

A tree diagram visually represents a hierarchy in a tree-like structure.

## Geography with overlays

### Choropleth map

A choropleth map uses differences in shading, coloring, or the placement of symbols within predefined areas to indicate the average values of a property or quantity in those areas.

### Proportional symbol

Symbols driven by data are overlayed in geographical regions. A common symbol used is a bubble with the area of the circle proportional to its value in the dataset.

### Connecting lines

Connection maps display points on a map connected by straight or curved lines.

Connection maps are most useful when showing connections and relationships geographically. They can also be used to display map routes through a single chain of links.

Connection maps are particularly powerful when revealing spatial patterns through the distribution of connections or by how concentrated connections are on a map.
